This paper talks about Mu, which is a serverless plantform that performs advance autoscaling, load balancing, and placement based on different parameters to satisfy the
services level objectives. Compared to traditional implmentations, it greatly improves the fairness and also reduces the responses time by 62%. In general, Mu is efficent
and greatly reduces the amount of resouces needed. However, it does inspire the consideration of "fairness". That is, what is considered as fair and what is considered as
not fair?
